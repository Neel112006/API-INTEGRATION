# API-INTEGRATION
A webpage that fetches and displays data from a public API (like Weather or News) allows users to view real-time information directly in their browser. Built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, it sends API requests, processes the JSON response, and dynamically updates the webpage â€” providing users with live updates in an interactive interface.
